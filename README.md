# VPN DNS Diagnostic Tool (PowerShell) ‚Äî v2.3

A Windows PowerShell, menu-driven utility for diagnosing and managing VPN DNS configuration on Windows endpoints.  
It validates the VPN profile name (via `Get-VpnConnection` and `rasphone.pbk`) before proceeding, caches user inputs for reuse throughout the session, and provides one-click actions for DNS checks, DNS cache/registration operations, connectivity tests, interface metric changes, and a comprehensive exportable diagnostic report.

## Features

- **VPN profile validation (3 attempts):**  
  Confirms the VPN profile exists using:
  - `Get-VpnConnection -Name` (user scope),
  - `Get-VpnConnection -AllUserConnection -Name` (machine scope),
  - and a fallback scan of `rasphone.pbk` files (user & all-users).

- **Input caching:**  
  Prompts once, then caches:
  - `VPN Profile Name`  
  - `Expected VPN DNS`  
  - `Desired Interface Metric` (optional - this will set what you want your interface to be versus what the current metric is).

- **Menu-driven operations:**  
  Quick views of DNS status and interface metric, bulk adapter DNS listings, DNS suffix views, DNS cache flush, registration, targeted A-record lookups against the VPN DNS, UDP/53 tests, temporary DNS set/reset, metric updates, and a full diagnostics export.

- **Exportable diagnostic report:**  
  One command collects, timestamps, and writes a detailed text report to a log folder.

- **Designed for enterprise use:**  
  All primary actions are idempotent and explicit, with confirmation prompts for changes.

- **Optional auto-elevation block:**  
  Commented code is included to relaunch with admin rights automatically if desired.

---

## Requirements

- **OS:** Windows 10 / Windows 11 (or Windows Server with the Windows VPN client components installed)  
- **PowerShell:** 5.1 or 7+ recommended  
- **Privileges:** Many change operations require **Administrator** (see Permissions & Safety)  
- **VPN profile:** Built-in Windows VPN profile present on the machine (or compatible adapter alias)

---

## Installation
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: If you directly download the Powershell script it may trigger a false positive. This is due to the code not being digitally signed yet.
    This will be addressed in our next update.
1. Copy the script to a folder, e.g. `C:\VPN\DNS-VPN-Diagnostics.ps1`.  
2. (Optional) Create the log directory (default: `C:\VPN\Logs`) or allow the tool to create it when exporting.  
3. If you always want elevated execution, uncomment the ‚ÄúAuto-elevate to Admin‚Äù block near the top of the script.

---

## Usage

### Interactive Menu
üí° Protip: Make sure you're connected to your VPN prior to running the script.
Open PowerShell (Run as Administrator for full functionality) and run:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\VPN\DNS-VPN-Diagnostics.ps1"
```

On first run you‚Äôll be prompted for:
-**Auto Detects Connected VPN**
- **VPN Profile Name** (validated, 3 attempts)
- **Expected VPN DNS** (e.g., `10.0.0.1`)
- **Desired Interface Metric** (optional; number or blank)

These are cached for the session and can be reviewed/changed with menu option **17**.

---

### Parameters

You can pre-seed values to skip prompts:

```powershell
.\DNS-VPN-Diagnostics.ps1 `
  -vpnName "Your VPN Name" `
  -expectedVpnDns "10.0.0.1" `
  -desiredMetric "5" `
  -LogDir "C:\VPN\Logs"
```

- `-vpnName` *(string)* ‚Äî VPN connection/profile name; validated before continuing.  
- `-expectedVpnDns` *(string)* ‚Äî IPv4 address you expect the VPN adapter to have as DNS.  
- `-desiredMetric` *(string)* ‚Äî Optional; numeric only. Leave blank to skip.  
- `-LogDir` *(string)* ‚Äî Folder for diagnostics export (default `C:\VPN\Logs`).

---

### Examples

Interactive (prompted):

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\VPN\DNS-VPN-Diagnostics.ps1"
```

Fully parameterized (non-interactive prompts):

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File "C:\VPN\DNS-VPN-Diagnostics.ps1" `
  -vpnName "Your-VPN-Name" `
  -expectedVpnDns "10.0.0.1" `
  -desiredMetric "5"
```

## Use Case: Quick workflow while connected to VPN

Scenario: You‚Äôre connected to the corporate VPN (IKEv2) and internal resources aren‚Äôt resolving.

Steps:
1. Connect to your VPN as usual (IKEv2 in this example).  
2. Launch the script (preferably as Administrator).  
3. Provide or confirm your VPN profile name and the expected DNS server IP when prompted (one-time per session).  
4. From the menu:
   - Choose **1** to confirm what DNS the VPN adapter currently has, the interface metric, and whether it matches your expected DNS.  
   - Choose **7** to test DNS resolution for an internal hostname using the VPN DNS server directly (helps determine if DNS or connectivity is at fault).  
   - If DNS is incorrect, choose **12** to temporarily set the VPN DNS to the expected value (requires admin). Re-run **1** or **7** to confirm.
   - If the adapter metric is wrong and you want traffic to prefer the VPN, set **15** (requires admin) with a previously cached desired metric.
   - Use **16** to export a full diagnostic report to `$LogDir` and attach it to an incident ticket if escalation is needed.
5. Press any key to return to the menu, or choose **18** to exit.

This flow helps quickly isolate whether DNS settings, reachability (ICMP/UDP), or the adapter metric are causing the failure.

### Connectivity to Expected VPN DNS (ICMP + UDP/53)
------------------------------------------------------------
ERROR: A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name 'Udp'.
(Note: This Error will occurr if you have ping disbaled via firewall rules. This is expected.).

```

## Permissions & Safety

- Viewing data: works as a standard user.  
- **Administrator** is required for:
  - Changing DNS on the VPN adapter (setting or resetting static DNS) ‚Äî menu **12** & **14**.  
  - Enabling `RegisterThisConnectionsAddress` ‚Äî menu **13**.  
  - Changing interface metric ‚Äî menu **15**.  
  - Running `ipconfig /registerdns` may require elevation depending on system policy.  

The script includes an optional auto-elevation block (commented). If you enable it, the script will attempt to relaunch itself with elevated privileges.

## Compatibility

| Platform / Component | Status | Notes |
|----------------------|--------:|-------|
| Windows 11 (x64)     | ‚úÖ Tested | Works with PowerShell 5.1+ and 7+. |
| Windows 10 (x64)     | ‚úÖ Tested | Works with PowerShell 5.1+ and 7+. |
| Windows Server       | ‚úÖ Partial | Works if Windows VPN client components/cmdlets are present. |
| CPU / Arch: Intel i5/i7 (64-bit) | ‚úÖ Tested | Script tested on an Intel i7 64-bit machine (development/test environment). |
| CPU / Arch: ARM (Windows on ARM) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited / Untested | The script **may** run under PowerShell 7 on Windows on ARM; however some modules/cmdlets (particularly `Get-VpnConnection` or vendor drivers) may behave differently. Not verified in the test environment ‚Äî use with care. |
| VPN Type: IKEv2      | ‚úÖ Tested | Script tested against IKEv2 connections (profile and DNS behaviors tested). |
| VPN Types: SSTP/L2TP/PPTP | ‚úÖ Likely | Basic adapter and DNS cmdlets are used; behavior may vary by client. |
| VPN Types: Azure VPN Client | ‚ùå Not Compatible | This script was created for Windows built in VPN structure. You can try to use Azure VPN Client with this script, but it is currently unsupported.  |

> If you test on Windows on ARM or other unusual configurations, please file an issue and attach a diagnostics export (menu 16) so we can improve coverage.

## Troubleshooting

- **‚ÄúVPN profile not found‚Äù on launch**  
  - Make sure you're connected to your VPN before running the script. This script has an VPN auto detection that should automatically detect your VPN while connected.
  - Ensure the VPN profile name matches exactly. The validator checks `Get-VpnConnection -Name` (user & alluser) and `rasphone.pbk`. If your VPN is a vendor client that doesn‚Äôt expose a Windows profile, use the adapter alias shown by `Get-NetAdapter` and enter that.

- **‚ÄúNo matching MSFT_DNSClientServerAddress objects‚Äù**  
  - This typically means the interface alias does not have IPv4 DNS server entries (VPN may be disconnected). Use the script‚Äôs detection (candidate list) to confirm aliases and ensure the VPN is connected.

- **Permissions / Access Denied**  
  - Rerun PowerShell as Administrator or enable the auto-elevate block near the top of the script.

- **Changes are reverted on reconnect**  
  - Some VPN clients reapply DNS on reconnection. Use the script to diagnose and re-apply as needed, or configure the client/provider side if persistent behavior is required.

---

## Known Limitations / Notes

- Windows-only ‚Äî relies on built-in Windows networking cmdlets.  
- Menu items **6** and **10** both show interface metrics (intentional convenience duplicate).  
- TEMP Set VPN DNS (menu **12**) sets a single DNS entry; add secondaries manually if required.  
- The script does not persist changes across VPN reconnects ‚Äî it is an operator tool for ad-hoc diagnostics and changes.  
- Interface alias is assumed to match the VPN profile name for built-in Windows VPN profiles.

---

## Changelog

### v2.3
- Added VPN profile validation (user & machine scope) and rasphone.pbk fallback with up to 3 attempts.  
- Input caching for VPN name, expected DNS, and desired metric.  
- Menu rework and expanded diagnostics export.  
- Added full diagnostics export to timestamped text file under `LogDir`.  
- Added safe DNS getter to avoid CIM errors when VPN adapters are disconnected.

---

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests welcome. When filing issues, include:
- Windows version and PowerShell version (`$PSVersionTable` output).  
- VPN type (IKEv2/SSTP/L2TP/etc.) and vendor if non-built-in.  
- Diagnostics export file generated with **menu 16** (redact private IPs if necessary).
